# <font color="CC0000">Claustrum Classifier: Automated electrophysiology based classification of claustrum neurons</font>


### Aditya Nair, Martin Graf, George Augustine<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

The claustrum is a mysterious nucleus of the brain that regulates diverse behaviour from sleep to attention and possibly even consciousness! At the heart of such myriad behaviours might be the presence of heterogenous cell-types in the claustrum. The Augustine lab has recently performed an extensive classification of claustrum neuron based on intrinsic electrophysiological properties and identified at least 5 such cell-types<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">1</a></sup>! The Claustrum Classifier allows anyone to use this scheme by providing software tools for automated extraction of cellular properties from ex-vivo electrophysiological data and classification using a trained neural net that can distinguish the cell-types identified in our publication.

## Using SilberReconstructor

> The software can either be downloaded in this github repository and used locally or be used online at the following link: [Claustrum Classifier](https://claustrum.shinyapps.io/online/)

## Using SilberReconstructor

>SilberReconstructor takes in three dimensional fluorescence microscopy images of neurobiotin filled neurons and applies pre-processing algorithms to remove the common sources of noise such as non-specific staining and neurobiotin leakage. It performs reconstruction using the APP1 or APP2 algorithms (Peng et al., 2011, Xiao et al., 2013) called from the Vaa3D platform (Peng et al., 2014). Post processing can be performed natively within SilberReconstructor or can be performed by calling the open source program NeuTube (Feng et al., 2015). 

## Ease of Use 

>SilberReconstructor acts as a pipeline that allows for the complete automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology. It presents a simple to use interface that allows users to proceed with analysis without any domain-specific knowledge in image processing.
